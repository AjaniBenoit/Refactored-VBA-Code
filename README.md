# Refactored VBA Code 

Analysis of refactored VBA code for Green Stocks excel file. 

## Overview of Project 

Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) was used to automate the analysis of the Green Stocks excel [VBA_Challenge.xlsm]( https://github.com/AjaniBenoit/Refactored-VBA-Code/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm) file to evaluate stock performance. The original VBA code allowed the user to input either the year 2017 or 2018 to calculate daily volume and yearly return for each stock.  To analyze larger dataset of stocks the VBA code was refactored to make it more efficient.
